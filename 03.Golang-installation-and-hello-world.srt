00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,640
 Hey there, everyone.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,180
 Hitesh here.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,880
 And in this video, we're going to install

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,680
 Golang in our system.

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,000
 And we'll also write some small amount of code,

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,160
 just kind of a hello world.

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,440
 So first, moving up here, the official thing, everything

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,040
 that we're going to see is on the golang.org.

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,200
 And this is where the entire documentation lives.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,160
 This is entirely all the downloadable resource lives.

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,360
 And we can also move away to other resources.

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,520
 This is kind of official home page for that.

14
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,020
 Now, a couple of interesting things.

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,680
 As the time of recording, the Golang is in 1.17 version.

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,840
 But obviously, you're going to check out this page later on.

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,080
 So any newer version is absolutely 100% fine for this.

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,120
 And I highly recommend you to go ahead and install

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,320
 the as latest version as you can find.

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,920
 The code files are going to absolutely work fine with that.

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,280
 So no problem in that.

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,800
 Now, any previous version, I don't

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,120
 recommend because there has been a couple of issues which

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,680
 has been addressed in the Golang,

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,640
 especially in the initial phases,

26
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,240
 the garbage collector was not up to the mark.

27
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,200
 So they have entirely rewritten that.

28
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,560
 And also, we will have a dedicated section

29
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,000
 about the modules, how Golang handles the collection

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
 and a whole lot of when different files are there.

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,320
 So the way how it handles was different previously.

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,480
 Now it has changed.

33
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,280
 So we'll be working on everything modern.

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,720
 Whole story short, please go ahead

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,160
 and install the latest version.

36
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,720
 Anything above 1.17 or 1.17 is absolutely fine for that.

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,140
 And also, you can see that on this home page,

38
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,560
 you can open up the Playground.

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,600
 And some of you, obviously, might

40
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,880
 be saying that, can I just learn Golang right here

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,120
 in the Playground?

42
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,000
 Technically, yeah, vaguely, you can go ahead and do that.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,480
 But I don't recommend that.

44
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,440
 Real applications are not built up

45
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,480
 when the application or the entire system

46
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,080
 is just in the browser.

47
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,280
 Maybe in the future, this is possible with the GitHub.

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,640
 But at least at the time of building real world

49
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,840
 development, you need to have things

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
 installed on your system.

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,600
 You are going to notice that, yes, you can run the code.

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,520
 And that's fine.

53
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,560
 You can just click on it.

54
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,440
 And it runs that.

55
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,680
 But it is on remote server.

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,840
 You don't know what is happening behind that server.

57
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,800
 For example, especially in the case

58
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,840
 of using the packages like random,

59
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,480
 especially the packages with the time and date,

60
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,600
 this goes absolutely crazy.

61
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,240
 And this is not going to give you any results that you expect.

62
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,640
 It is also going to be not configurable.

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
 So it is not a good idea to use the Playground for testing out

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
 few algorithms.

65
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,040
 It's fine.

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
 But I don't recommend anything after that.

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,840
 So for this Go Playground, a big go no for that.

68
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,200
 Let's go back.

69
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,040
 Now, for the code editor, what I'll

70
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,840
 be using for this entire series is

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
 going to be Visual Studio Code, which

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,280
 has happened to be the code editor which I'm using

73
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,080
 these days, couple of years now.

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
 And I absolutely love that.

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,240
 Feel free to use any other.

76
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,800
 Maybe Sublime Text is your favorite.

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,240
 So please go ahead and feel free to use that.

78
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,640
 But please, for God's sake, don't use Notepad.

79
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,920
 Anything which can make your words

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,320
 as bold, italic, and underline, that is not a code editor.

81
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,960
 That is a word processor.

82
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,720
 For God's sake, don't use word processor to write code.

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,520
 Use code editor, something like VS Code, Sublime Text,

84
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,280
 or similar.

85
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,320
 Anyways, enough of that.

86
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,520
 Now let's go ahead and click onto the Go Download

87
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,840
 and get the download.

88
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,920
 And again, as you can see, it's pretty easy to download now.

89
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,160
 You can have Windows as MSI, Microsoft Installer.

90
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,240
 Click, click, I agree, next.

91
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,240
 Or for Apple PKG, again, click, click, I agree, next.

92
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,440
 And for Linux also.

93
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,840
 If you are on Linux, you obviously

94
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,120
 know how to handle the tar.gif file here, the zip files.

95
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,320
 Now we're going to go ahead and get the package one.

96
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,280
 It's 130 MB, should be fairly small.

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
 And we got it up here.

98
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,840
 Now VS Code is already installed on my system.

99
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,680
 I'm going to go ahead and open this up.

100
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,280
 And shouldn't be a big deal to install this.

101
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,640
 It is going to come up on my other screen.

102
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,920
 Let's bring it up here.

103
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,760
 So a previous installation is detected.

104
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,640
 In case this is your case, then it's

105
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
 going to be remove-- it will automatically remove that.

106
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,520
 So no problem in that.

107
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,360
 I'm going to go ahead and click on Continue.

108
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,760
 It says, hey, I'm going to go ahead and install that.

109
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,400
 It's going to ask me for password.

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,080
 So I'll add that.

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,480
 And shouldn't be taking too much long.

112
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,600
 OK, so it took a minute, a little bit while.

113
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,920
 But it is all installed.

114
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,960
 So I can go ahead and close this one.

115
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,880
 Now we're going to not just stop up here.

116
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,920
 We are going to go ahead and move on to one step.

117
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,000
 At least let's just roll out a Hello World here.

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,340
 And I'm going to show you a couple of interesting stuff.

119
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,680
 So I can go ahead and right click and move it to bin.

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,200
 So this is the entire directory where I'll keep everything.

121
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,040
 And for the initial few days, I highly

122
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
 recommend to keep the directory names, files,

123
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,600
 and the structure, everything exactly same as mine.

124
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,440
 Once we move on to the phase of modules

125
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,640
 and you've understood that, then you can go ahead and change

126
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
 everything whatever you like.

127
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,360
 Right now, we don't have that knowledge

128
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,560
 to change the file names and the directory structure.

129
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,840
 So go ahead, keep it on desktop or somewhere.

130
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,400
 Just go ahead and create a new folder.

131
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,920
 We're going to call this one as my golang-lco.

132
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,320
 So we're going to keep everything inside this one.

133
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,400
 I'm going to go ahead and just place it up here.

134
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,280
 OK, very interestingly, I need an instance of VS Code now.

135
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,880
 So I'll fire that up.

136
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,920
 And directly just go ahead and drag and drop this my-golang

137
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,440
 up here.

138
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,200
 And yes, I trust the author, at least myself.

139
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,520
 So there we go.

140
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,080
 Let's go ahead and use the entire real estate.

141
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,200
 Nice and easy.

142
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
 Now in here, I'm going to go ahead and create

143
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,400
 a new directory first.

144
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,000
 Make sure you also follow the same.

145
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,960
 I'm going to name this one as 01-hello.

146
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,640
 And make sure you also follow exactly this very closely.

147
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,240
 And now I'm going to go ahead and right click on this one.

148
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,180
 And we'll create a new file.

149
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,520
 And that one will be main.go.

150
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,320
 Now right click-- just go ahead and hit Enter on this one.

151
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,200
 Now as soon as you're on this file,

152
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,400
 you do not need to write anything.

153
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,000
 The go, how it handles everything,

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,160
 is completely different and has changed

155
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,200
 in case you have watched any other previous video.

156
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,800
 Now we need to do some things a little bit differently.

157
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,440
 I'm going to first right click on this.

158
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,200
 And I'm going to say that I want to open it

159
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,800
 in integrated terminal.

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,840
 In case you are using any other code editor,

161
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 make sure you just visit that particular directory.

162
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,080
 So I'm into this 01-hello as of now.

163
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,120
 Now the first thing that you have to write,

164
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
 since you have installed Go on your system,

165
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,880
 you have ability to use the tool chains or the tools that

166
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,640
 are given to you by Golang.

167
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,280
 One of the important thing before even you write any code

168
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,800
 is to say go mod init.

169
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,400
 This is almost can be considered-- not exactly,

170
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,280
 but almost can be considered as npm init in case

171
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,360
 you have worked with that.

172
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,880
 In case not, that's fine.

173
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,520
 And after that, usually the recommendation

174
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,200
 is to say something like this, github.com/ then your name,

175
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,080
 which is really big in my case, and say simply hello like this.

176
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,040
 Now we're not going to go this much of big

177
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,080
 because we are not at that position right now.

178
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
 So we're going to just go ahead and remove this.

179
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,120
 This is the official way.

180
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
 And we are going to come on to the official way,

181
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,600
 so don't worry on that part.

182
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,640
 Right now we're going to all say is go mod init and hello.

183
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,160
 As soon as I hit Enter, this is what it gives us.

184
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,200
 No, we don't need to write any go mod tidy

185
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,080
 or any other command.

186
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
 We'll work on that later on.

187
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,680
 What it gives me is a file which says go.mod.

188
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,960
 It says module is hello, and my go version is 1.17.

189
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,080
 Now wait a minute before you get angry or any more

190
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,240
 cautious about this.

191
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,040
 Don't worry.

192
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,600
 We have an entire dedicated section on just this file.

193
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,720
 So don't you worry on that.

194
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
 Right now you can safely ignore that.

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,280
 OK, once you're done with that, now we're

196
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,240
 going to go into the main file.

197
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,640
 Now first thing that we're going to write here is simply

198
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,320
 go ahead and say package main.

199
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,640
 But the issue is as soon as I'm going to save this,

200
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,640
 this doesn't know how to read and color code properly

201
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
 my Go files.

202
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,400
 So I need to install some tools that

203
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,680
 can help me to give the intellisense of the Go files.

204
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,320
 I'm going to save this one up here.

205
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,200
 And I'm going to go ahead and move and search

206
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,160
 for the extension.

207
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,700
 So I'm going to go ahead and search for the extension, which

208
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,200
 is Go.

209
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,440
 And you'll be getting the first one by the Go team at Google.

210
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,160
 This is exactly what I want.

211
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,440
 I want this one.

212
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,040
 So seems like all good.

213
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,600
 There is another one here.

214
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,960
 Yeah, it's in review.

215
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,880
 No, I don't want that.

216
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,000
 I want this one here.

217
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,680
 So I'm going to go ahead and install that.

218
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,440
 And it's all good.

219
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,160
 Now also, you're going to get some of the things that, hey,

220
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,840
 do you want to update the tools and recompile in case

221
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,280
 everything is previously installed?

222
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,680
 Yes, I want to do that.

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,640
 So make sure to click on Install All.

224
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,320
 Anything that you see at the bottom right corner,

225
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,640
 make sure you always click on this Install All,

226
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,280
 especially in the case of Go.

227
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,680
 Because there are a lot of other libraries in package

228
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,400
 which Go brings up and which is going

229
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,240
 to help you to install a lot of things, tool chains.

230
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,740
 Remember I told you, this is exactly

231
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,520
 what it is doing right now.

232
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,800
 OK, so this is all good.

233
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,240
 And it thinks like everything is succeeding.

234
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,600
 And it looks like it is all done.

235
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,640
 And we can go back onto our file.

236
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,680
 Let's go back onto the main.go.

237
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,800
 And it looks like this is going to take a little bit while

238
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,600
 to install that.

239
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,640
 So I'm going to just wait for a couple of seconds.

240
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,360
 Don't worry, I'll fast forward this.

241
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,640
 OK, so all tools are successfully installed.

242
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
 And hopefully it's not going to pop me up again

243
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,320
 for installation.

244
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,160
 If it does, I'll definitely do accept that.

245
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,040
 And I'll show you what it has installed all,

246
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,680
 where I can find the parts, and a whole bunch of other things.

247
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
 So don't you worry on that part.

248
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,320
 Let's go back onto the terminal.

249
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,080
 OK, this is 9.

250
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,400
 I'm going to clean this up.

251
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,640
 By the way, the shortcut is Control plus L

252
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,040
 to clean your terminal.

253
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,120
 Now let's go up here.

254
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,920
 Now usually, you're going to see that people

255
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,200
 write an import statement.

256
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
 You don't need to do that, because you have installed

257
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,600
 the Go IntelliSense up here.

258
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,080
 So we're not going to do that.

259
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,760
 We're going to go ahead and directly say

260
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,040
 I want to create a function.

261
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,240
 So notice here, I'm going to just click on Enter.

262
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
 And this is the function.

263
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,760
 But in case you're going to go ahead and say that I want

264
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,760
 a function declaration and use the Go IntelliSense that we

265
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,120
 have used, it's going to just auto fill some of the stuff

266
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,620
 for me.

267
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,640
 And I love that.

268
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,520
 We're going to go ahead and say that this is my main function.

269
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,880
 In the world of Go, it is very similar to languages

270
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,160
 like C and C++.

271
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,720
 So there is always a one entry point,

272
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,440
 which is going to act as the starting point for a program.

273
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
 And this is main.

274
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,520
 So this is a reserved keyword.

275
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,160
 You cannot give it to anybody else.

276
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,400
 This is what we have.

277
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,840
 Now, the next thing I want you to do is just type fmt and dot.

278
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,000
 Then we're going to write println.

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,200
 Now, one of the most important thing about the Go

280
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,120
 is it is super case sensitive.

281
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,520
 But it is very predictably case sensitive.

282
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,880
 For example, all the methods that probably you

283
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,440
 can use from any package--

284
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,840
 in our case, fmt--

285
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,880
 these packages are-- these methods from these packages

286
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,240
 are named with a capital letter.

287
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,080
 And there is a huge importance of that.

288
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,720
 We'll come back on this later on.

289
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,400
 Now, I'm going to go ahead and say that I

290
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
 want to use the parentheses.

291
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,640
 And we're going to go ahead and say hello from learncodeonline.

292
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,120
 Dot in, of course.

293
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,040
 Now, I'm going to go ahead and save this.

294
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,840
 As soon as I save this, notice it automatically

295
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,920
 imported the fmt package for me.

296
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,800
 Now, this is one of the beauty about writing

297
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,280
 the code for the Go that you don't really

298
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,600
 go ahead and keep on adding the import statement.

299
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,960
 Go automatically cleans and uncleans

300
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,360
 the packages which you need or probably you don't need.

301
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,680
 And that's pretty much it.

302
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,280
 Now, you can go ahead and save this one.

303
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,840
 Now, there are a couple of other things which we can do

304
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
 and which we obviously will do in the future.

305
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,160
 But right now, I just want to run this program.

306
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,960
 So I'm going to go ahead and say Go.

307
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,120
 Then I'm going to use the keyword run.

308
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,080
 And then I'm going to name the file, which is main.go.

309
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,940
 Now, this is going to just run the file.

310
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,560
 This is not going to build it.

311
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,560
 So we are not going to get any executables

312
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,800
 which you can execute.

313
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
 We'll talk about that later on for sure.

314
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,400
 But right now, all I want to see is just a hello world.

315
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,600
 That is absolutely great here.

316
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,140
 Now, shortly later on, I'll walk you

317
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,520
 through how you can generate the packages for Windows

318
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,680
 and for Linux and for Mac as well.

319
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,960
 And don't you worry.

320
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,520
 In case you are on a Mac, you can generate the exe for Windows.

321
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,360
 And in case you are on Windows, you can generate exe for Mac

322
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,160
 as well.

323
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,280
 There is no problem in that at all.

324
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,960
 So I guess that's it for this video.

325
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,800
 In the next video, we're going to enhance this

326
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,520
 a little bit more.

327
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,240
 We'll explore a little bit more about it.

328
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,000
 And we're going to talk about it later on.

329
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,120
 Let's catch up in the next video.
