00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 Welcome to the series on complete Go programming language.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,640
 Go programming language, also known as Golang,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,040
 is already being loved by startups.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,320
 And also, this language is already in production

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,280
 for giants like Google and Dropbox and many others.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,480
 Now, this brings this programming language

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,440
 already into a unique position where startups are loving it,

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,780
 as well as it is already present in giants.

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,120
 This is an amazing programming language,

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,160
 which you are going to love.

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,080
 Hey there, everyone.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,920
 My name is Hitesh,

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,480
 and I'll be your instructor for this entire series

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,800
 on the Golang.

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,440
 I've been writing code for a while,

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,400
 and I know how to teach that code as well.

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,560
 My specialty is to turn the toughest topic

18
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,720
 in the easiest one so that learning becomes absolute fun.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,760
 In this series of Go programming language,

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,520
 we are going to get started with absolute basics.

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
 First, we're gonna clear up

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,720
 that how Go programming language is different

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,880
 or similar to other programming language.

24
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,920
 Once we are done with that,

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,040
 we are going to learn how to install Golang

26
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,360
 onto your local system,

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
 and we'll fire up our VS code

28
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,960
 to write our very first program.

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,980
 Once we are done with that,

30
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,040
 the obvious next step is to understand

31
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,080
 how the Golang work, its lexer,

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,400
 how we declare variables, conditional loops and functions.

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,420
 Once we have good practice of these basics,

34
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,840
 then we are going to move into the web side

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,400
 of a programming language.

36
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,880
 We're going to learn about the structs,

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,960
 and we are going to explore how we can create

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,860
 as well as decode JSON.

39
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,020
 We're going to learn about how to make web request,

40
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,040
 how to accept the response from the web request,

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,840
 and during this, JSON is going to help us a lot.

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,060
 After that, we are going to learn

43
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,840
 that how we can build APIs

44
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,420
 using whatever the knowledge we have gained so far.

45
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,800
 Once we are done with the building of the basic APIs,

46
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,920
 then in the next module,

47
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,600
 we are going to learn that how we can inject MongoDB

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,200
 and can create a full-fledged REST API

49
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,300
 using Golang and MongoDB.

50
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,600
 Once we are done with all of that,

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,940
 then we are going to move into the most amazing section

52
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,180
 of the Go programming language,

53
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,480
 which is how to fire up goroutines,

54
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,080
 sync packages, mutex, and channels.

55
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,600
 This entire series is jam-packed with fun,

56
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,000
 a lot of code that we're going to write together,

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,280
 as well as together,

58
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,480
 we're going to go ahead and read the documentation

59
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,920
 to find out behind-the-scene details

60
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,280
 of the Go programming language.

61
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,000
 I know reading documentation is not that much fun,

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,720
 but don't you worry, I'll take care of that,

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,200
 and I'll teach you enough of the basics

64
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,400
 so that documentation doesn't scare you off.

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,600
 After watching this series,

66
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,040
 you are going to realize

67
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,760
 that Golang is not just any another programming language.

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,800
 It solves very unique issues,

69
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,520
 and it is one of the most ideal programming language

70
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,760
 if you're working into the cloud infrastructure.

71
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,480
 Channels, mutex, goroutines, sync packages, pointers,

72
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
 there is so much in this language

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,440
 and is having a fresh take

74
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,200
 on how to deal up with the things.

75
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,840
 Learning Golang in this present era

76
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,720
 is going to take you a step ahead

77
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,760
 into your journey of programming.

78
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,000
 So obviously, the next question is

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,840
 that how can you access this series

80
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,260
 and what this series is going to cost you?

81
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,320
 Now, if you are a member of pro.learncodeonline.in,

82
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,920
 then this entire series will be available to you

83
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,860
 entirely on the day one.

84
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,160
 But don't you worry, if you are not a member of that,

85
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,180
 that is also fine.

86
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,800
 You can still access this series.

87
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,760
 A lot of you gave me a lot of love and support

88
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,160
 by subscribing to pro.learncodeonline,

89
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,560
 and as a saying thank you or as a gesture,

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
 I just kept this entire series

91
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,880
 absolutely for free for YouTube.

92
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,080
 So every single day,

93
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,280
 we are going to post up one video a day,

94
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,480
 just like YouTube loves it, one video a day.

95
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,600
 Every single day on 5 p.m.,

96
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,640
 you are going to see one video a day.

97
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,420
 So you can just spend five to 10 minutes in a day,

98
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,120
 and within just no time,

99
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,360
 you will be absolutely mastering Golang.

100
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,880
 And by the way, just quick side note,

101
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,400
 we don't upload on Saturdays

102
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,680
 because I go live on Saturday,

103
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,720
 so you won't be seeing videos on Saturday.

104
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,960
 Rest on all of the days,

105
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,520
 you are going to see one video a day sharp at 5 p.m.

106
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,360
 I will already pre-upload everything

107
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,800
 and will mark them as a scheduled video

108
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,080
 so that you can see all of that.

109
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,200
 So yes, summing it up,

110
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,080
 yes, this series is going to be free.

111
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,000
 You are going to see one video a day

112
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,440
 if you want to watch it on YouTube.

113
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,720
 If you are already a Pro member,

114
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,640
 you can just access it all in one go.

115
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,200
 And yes, of course, a big shout out

116
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,000
 to all the people who have supported me

117
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
 on pro.learncodeonline,

118
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,600
 and because of you guys,

119
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,360
 this series was made possible,

120
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,380
 and because of your love and support,

121
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,940
 this series is absolutely free for everyone.

122
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,780
 I am super excited to share all the journey

123
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,160
 that I have seen so far while working in the project,

124
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,520
 digging up into the documentation, everything.

125
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,000
 And this is going to be one fantastic series.

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,200
 I am hoping that all of you will show up eventually,

127
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,120
 and let's go ahead and get started

128
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,880
 with Go programming language.

129
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,440
 And yeah, by the way, a side note,

130
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,400
 the music is going to be only in this video.

131
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,920
 The rest of the videos are not going to get

132
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,520
 the ending music that some of you are a big fan of.

133
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,100
